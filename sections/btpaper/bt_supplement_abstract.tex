In this supplement, we will provide a full walk-through of the examples given
in \cref{btdde:sec:Examples} with
\DDEBIFTOOL\footnote{\url{http://ddebiftool.sourceforge.net/}}
\cite{2014arXiv1406.7144S}. Additionally, the Julia code, used for the
numerical simulation, with the package {\tt
DifferentialEquations.jl}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl}}
\cite{rackauckas2017differentialequations} is shown. Some new results were
obtained while studying these models.

This allows other researchers to fully replicate the findings in the main text.
Other DDE models, undergoing generic or transcritical Bogdanov--Takens
bifurcations treated in this paper, can easily be studied by simply modifying
the given code. The code here has also been included into the \DDEBIFTOOL
package on the source-forge repository and can be executed without the need to
copy and paste. In this supplement we mainly focus on the initialization and
continuation of the various codim-1 equilibrium and homoclinic bifurcation
curves emanating from the Bogdanov--Takens points and also on numerical
simulation near the bifurcation points. For a more complete overview of the
capabilities and functionality for \DDEBIFTOOL we refer to the online tutorials
files and also the manual and the references therein.

Note that reading this supplement may feel at times somewhat repetitive. We see
this as a positive sign. Indeed, our predictors need little adjustment
before starting continuation of the codimension one curves emanating from the
generic and transcritical Bogdanov--Takens bifurcation.

To follow the examples below, we recommend using the \DDEBIFTOOL package
supplied with the article. Also note that the \MATLAB code has been tested on 
\MATLAB 2020b and \OCTAVE 6.4.0 using \OCTAVE symbolic
package version 2.9.0. Different results may occur on other version of 
\MATLAB or \OCTAVE.
