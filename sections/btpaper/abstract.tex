In this \paper{}, we will perform the parameter-dependent center manifold reduction
near the generic and transcritical codimension two Bogdanov--Takens bifurcation
in classical delay differential equations (DDEs). Using a generalization of the
Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method to approximate the homoclinic solution allows us to
initialize the continuation of the homoclinic bifurcation curves emanating from
these points. The normal form transformation is derived in the functional
analytic perturbation framework for dual semigroups (sun-star calculus) using a
normalization technique based on the Fredholm alternative. The obtained
expressions give explicit formulas, which have been implemented in the freely
available bifurcation software package \DDEBIFTOOL. The effectiveness is
demonstrated on various models\ifthesis\footnote{Submitted as}\fi.
