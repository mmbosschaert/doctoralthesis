This \paper{} provides for the first time correct third-order homoclinic
predictors in $n$-dimensional ODEs near a generic Bogdanov--Takens bifurcation
point.  To achieve this, higher-order time approximations to the nonlinear time
transformation in the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method are essential. Moreover, a
correct transform between approximations to solutions in the normal form and
approximations to solutions on the parameter-dependent center manifold is
derived rigorously.  A detailed comparison is done between applying different
normal forms (smooth and orbital), different phase conditions, and different
perturbation methods (regular and Lindstedt-Poincar\'e) to approximate the
homoclinic solution near Bogdanov--Takens points.  Examples demonstrating the
correctness of the predictors are given. The new homoclinic predictors are
implemented in the open-source \MATLAB/\OCTAVE continuation package \MATCONT\ifthesis\footnote{Submitted as}\fi.
